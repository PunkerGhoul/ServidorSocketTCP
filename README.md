# ServidorSocketTCP

This Java code defines a simple TCP server, `InitServer`, utilizing the `ServerSocket` class to handle incoming client connections. The server supports a multi-threaded architecture with an `ExecutorService` managing a fixed pool of threads. The main method presents a menu allowing the user to either start the server or exit the program. The server, upon initiation, prompts the user to manually input a port number or generate a random one within a specified range. The `startServer` method establishes a server socket, listens for incoming client connections, and delegates each connection to a separate thread (`ClientHandler`) for concurrent handling. The `ClientHandler` class, implemented as an inner class, manages communication with individual clients by reading and broadcasting messages to all connected clients. The server logs relevant information using the `Logger` class.
